# Auto Clicker Pro
Auto Clicker Pro is a high-performance automated clicking tool featuring an ultra-clean UI built with ttkbootstrap for crisp, professional rendering. It is designed with advanced features like random interval offsets and specific cursor targeting to provide a seamless automation experience.

## 🚀 Key Features
Precision Timing: Set click intervals using hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

Randomized Intervals: Enable a "Random offset" to vary click timing by a specified number of milliseconds, making automation feel more natural.

### Targeted Clicking:

Current Location: Clicks wherever the mouse is currently hovering.

Pick Location: Allows you to set specific X and Y coordinates for the clicker to lock onto.

Advanced Click Options: Select between Left, Right, or Middle mouse buttons and choose Single or Double click types.

Flexible Repeat Modes: Configure the app to repeat a specific number of times or run infinitely until stopped.

DPI Awareness: Optimized for Windows to ensure the interface remains sharp on high-resolution monitors.

Global Hotkey: Quickly start or stop clicking using the F6 key.

## 📖 How to Use
Set the Interval: Enter your desired time between clicks in the "Click interval" section.

Choose Mouse Settings: Select which button to use (Left, Middle, Right) and the click type (Single, Double).

Choose Repeat Mode: Select "Repeat" and enter a number, or choose "Repeat until stopped".

Position the Cursor:

Keep it on "Current location" to click where you point.

Select "Pick location" and enter X/Y coordinates to click a specific button on your screen.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
Record & Playback: This feature is currently a placeholder and is planned for a future update.
